		<h1>What is the DieBenutzerumgebung?</h1>
		The DieBenutzerumgebung is a collection of configurations and and scripts that give me a calming and consistent desktop experience.
		To achieve that I have generated a GTK2/3 theme using oomox and the theme/iconset Numix as base (plus dircolors, shell colors and so on)
		using a colorscheme that is mainly influenced by solarized dark. As font-face I decided to use Roboto and RobotoMono.
		The matching colors and fonts are configured for all applications/thermes that I use.<br />
		<br />
		Also I setup most applications to have the same keyboard shortcuts. For example <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> = jump to beginning of line
		and <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> = jump to end of line. Or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>+/-/=</kbd> and to scale fonts like in Firefox.
		This is implemented for VIM, Firefox, urxvt (the terminal) and some other tools. Maybe you'll say <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>
		is already mapped to select all and can't be remapped. Or maybe you say gVIM wont be able to map <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>+/-/=</kbd>
		because of the ASCII standard. You are right. But I have solved that with the <i>xkeys.zsh</i> script I created.
		You can read more on that on the projects github page. However, I miss <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> sometimes to select all in Firefox.<br />
		<br />
		So if you have interest in helping to design a consistent keymap or maybe you use different applications and want to
		contribute configuratons, or maybe something else, contact me.
